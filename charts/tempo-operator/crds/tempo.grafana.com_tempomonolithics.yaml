                          a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is

                          for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource
                          request, requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.),

                          "weight" to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the
                          node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred.

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

                        with respect to the current state of the instance.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
