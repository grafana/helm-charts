    # leaderElectionReleaseOnCancel defines if the leader should step down volume
    # when the Manager ends. This requires the binary to immediately end when the
    # Manager is stopped, otherwise, this setting is unsafe. Setting this significantly
    # speeds up voluntary leader transitions as the new leader don't have to wait
    # LeaseDuration time first.
    # In the default scaffold provided, the program ends immediately after
    # the manager stops, so would be fine to enable this option. However,
    # if you are doing or is intended to do any operation such as perform cleanups
    # after the manager stops then its usage might be unsafe.
