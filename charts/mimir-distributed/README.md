# Notice of relocation

The `mimir-distributed` chart source code has moved to the [Grafana Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir) GitHub repository.

Contents of this file, including installation instructions are moved to this [README.md](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/README.md) in the new repository.

## Usage

Usage will not be impacted, the `mimir-distributed` chart will continue to be released to the same [https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts](https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts) Helm repository as before.

## Issue tracking

No need to move, reopen issues. New issues should be opened on the [Grafana Mimir issue](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/issues) page, however maintainers will keep processing the issues in the current [Grafana Community Kubernetes Helm Charts issues](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/issues) page as well.

## Contributing

New pull requests must be opened against the `main` branch in the [Grafana Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir) GitHub repository. Maintainers will help moving existing pull requests from the current repository to [Grafana Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir) based on priority and best effort.
