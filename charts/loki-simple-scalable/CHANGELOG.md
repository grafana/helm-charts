## 1.6.0

- [FEATURE] Added self-monitoring option, with dashboards and Grafana Agent Operator custom resources to allow Loki to scrape it's own logs.
- [CHANGE] Move `serviceMonitor` configuraiton under `monitoring` section, which now also includes a section for `dashboards` and `selfMonitoring`.

## 1.5.0

-[CHANGE] Set `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy` for read pods to `Delete` for both `whenDeleted` and `whenScaled` since this data is easy to replace by re-fetching from object storage. This should make for easier roll-outs of the stateful sets.
