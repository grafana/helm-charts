# Changelog

All notable changes to this library will be documented in this file.

Entries should be ordered as follows:
- [CHANGE]
- [FEATURE]
- [ENHANCEMENT]
- [BUGFIX]

Entries should include a reference to the Pull Request that introduced the change.

## 1.5.3

* [BUGFIX] This change does not affect single replica deployments of the
  admin-api but does fix the potential for an inconsistent state when
  running with multiple replicas of the admin-api and experiencing
  parallel writes for the same objects. #675

## 1.5.2

* [CHANGE] Removed all references to Consul in the yaml files since GEM will be focused on deploying with memberlist. Deleted the multi-kv-consul-primary-values.yaml and multi-kv-memberlist-primary-values.yaml files since they assume you're running Consul as your primary or second kvstore. #674

## 1.5.1

* [BUGFIX] Unused `ingress` configuration section removed from `values.yaml`. #658

## 1.5.0

* [FEATURE] Upgrade to [Grafana Enterprise Metrics v1.5.0](https://grafana.com/docs/metrics-enterprise/latest/downloads/#v150----august-24th-2021). #641

## 1.4.7

* [CHANGE] Enabled enterprise authentication by default.
  > **Breaking:** This change can cause losing access to the GEM cluster in case `auth.type` has not
  > been set explicitly.
  > This is a security related change and therefore released in a patch release.

## 1.4.6

* [FEATURE] Run an instance of the GEM overrides-exporter by default. #590

## 1.4.5

* [BUGFIX] Add `memberlist.join` configuration to the ruler. #618

## 1.4.4

* [CHANGE] Removed livenessProbe configuration as it can often be more detrimental than having none. Users can still configure livenessProbes with the per App configuration hooks. #594

## 1.4.3

* [ENHANCEMENT] Added values files for installations that require setting resource limits. #583

## 1.4.2

* [CHANGE] The compactor data directory configuration has been corrected to `/data`. #562
  > **Note:** The compactor is stateless and no data stored in the existing data directory needs to be moved in order to facilitate this upgrade.
  > For more information, refer to the [Cortex Compactor documentation](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/compactor/).
* [FEATURE] Upgrade to [Grafana Enterprise Metrics v1.4.2](https://grafana.com/docs/metrics-enterprise/latest/downloads/#v142----jul-21st-2021) #562

## 1.4.1

* [BUGFIX] Fixed DNS address of distributor client for self-monitoring. #569

## 1.4.0

* [CHANGE] Use updated querier response compression configuration, changed in 1.4.0. #524
* [CHANGE] Use updated alertmanager storage configuration, changed in 1.4.0. #524
* [FEATURE] Upgrade to [Grafana Enterprise Metrics v1.4.1](https://grafana.com/docs/metrics-enterprise/latest/downloads/#v141----june-29th-2021). #524
* [FEATURE] Enable [GEM self-monitoring](https://grafana.com/docs/metrics-enterprise/latest/self-monitoring/). #524

## 1.3.5

* [CHANGE] The GRPC port on the query-frontend and store-gateway Kubernetes Services have been changed to match the naming of all other services. #523
* [FEATURE] Expose GRPC port on all GEM services. #523

## 1.3.4

* [BUGFIX] Removed symlinks from chart to fix Rancher repository imports. #504

## 1.3.3

* [FEATURE] The GEM config now uses the `{{ .Release.Name }}` variable as the default value for `cluster_name` which removes the need to additionally override this setting during an initial install. #500

## 1.3.2

* [FEATURE] Chart memcached dependencies are now at the latest release. This includes the memcached and the related exporter. #467

## 1.3.1

* [BUGFIX] Use non-deprecated alertmanager flags for cluster peers. #441
* [BUGFIX] Make store-gateway Service not headless. #441

## 1.3.0

* [FEATURE] Upgrade to [Grafana Enterprise Metrics v1.3.0](https://grafana.com/docs/metrics-enterprise/latest/downloads/#v130----april-26th-2021). #415

## 1.2.0

* [CHANGE] The chart now uses memberlist for the ring key-value store removing the need to run Consul. #340
  > **Warning:** Existing clusters will need to follow an upgrade procedure.
  > **Warning:** Existing clusters should first be upgraded to `v1.1.1` and use that version for migration before upgrading to `v1.2.0`.
  To upgrade to using memberlist:
  1. Ensure you are running the `v1.1.1` version of the chart.
  2. Deploy runtime `multi_kv_config` to use Consul as a primary and memberlist as the secondary key-value store.
     The values for such a change can be found in the [`multi-kv-consul-primary-values.yaml`](./multi-kv-consul-primary-values.yaml).
  3. Verify the configuration is in use by querying the [Configuration](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/api/#configuration) HTTP API endpoint.
  4. Deploy runtime `multi_kv_config` to use memberlist as the primary and Consul as the secondary key-value store.
     The values for such a change can be found in [`multi-kv-memberlist-primary-values.yaml`](./multi-kv-memberlist-primary-values.yaml)
  5. Verify the configuration is in use by querying the [Configuration](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/api/#configuration) HTTP API endpoint.
  6. Deploy `v1.2.0` helm chart which configures memberlist as the sole key-value store and removes the Consul resources.

## 1.1.1

* [FEATURE] Facilitate some runtime configuration of microservices. #342
* [FEATURE] Upgrade to [Grafana Enterprise Metrics v1.2.0](https://grafana.com/docs/metrics-enterprise/latest/downloads/#v120----march-10-2021). #342

## 1.1.0

* [CHANGE] The memcached chart from the deprecated Helm stable repository has been removed and replaced with a Bitnami chart. #333
  > **Warning:** This change will result in the cycling of your memcached Pods and will invalidate the existing cache.
* [CHANGE] Memcached Pod resource limits have been lowered to match requests. #333
* [FEATURE] YAML exports have been created for all chart values files. #333
* [BUGFIX] The values for the querier/ruler/store-gateway `-<prefix>.memcached.max-item-size` have been corrected to match the limit configured on the memcached server. #333

## 1.0.0

* [FEATURE] Initial versioned release. ##168
