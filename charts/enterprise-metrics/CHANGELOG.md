## 1.2.0

* [CHANGE] The chart now uses memberlist for the ring key-value store removing the need to run Consul. #340
  > **Warning:** Existing clusters will need to follow an upgrade procedure.

  To upgrade to using memberlist:
  1. Ensure you are running the `v1.1.1` version of the chart.
  2. Deploy runtime `multi_kv_config` to use Consul as a primary and memberlist as the secondary key-value store.
     The values for such a change can be found in the [`multi-kv-consul-primary-values.yaml`](./multi-kv-consul-primary-values.yaml).
  3. Verify the configuration is in use by querying the [Configuration](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/api/#configuration) HTTP API endpoint.
